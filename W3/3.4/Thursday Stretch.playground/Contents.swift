//Make a function that takes in the cost of an item, and the amount of money paid (i.e. the cost is $2.15 and the amount of money paid is $5.00) and then returns a string detailing the amount of change in dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

//When this works, try to recreate Swift's built-in filter function. Just like the Swift function, it should be generic and it should take a closure that returns a Bool, from which it determines how to filter your sequence type.
