//Create a function that takes an Int as a parameter and prints it to the console the way an old-school alarm clock would look. You may create auxiliary functions if needed.
//
//For example, if you pass 257 the console might look something like this:
//
//---   ---  ---
//| |        |
//---   ---     |
//|         |    |
//---   ---
//

//Modify the function to take an Int array and print each number in the same fashion but on its own line.
